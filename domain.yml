    text: Do you know what a REST-based API is?
  utter_e2s2_story_2:
  - text: We now want to use the APIs of the two enterpise applications **OrangeHRM**
      and **OpenCRX**. For example, we can use it to obtain information such as "Which
      employees with the job of salesperson are there?" or "How many vacuum cleaners
      could a particular employee sell?" 💸
  utter_e2s2_story_3:
  - text: To address the APIs, we need the tool "Postman". Have you downloaded it
      yet?
  utter_e2s2_story_4:
  - text: 'No problem. You can download it for free: https://www.postman.com/downloads/'
  utter_e2s2_story_5:
  - text: Can we continue?
  utter_e2s2_story_6:
  - text: Okay, with questions about the contents please read my last messages again.
      And make sure you have installed the tool. I'm waiting for your okay to continue.
  utter_e2s2_story_7:
  - text: "Excellent! First, let's look at the **OrangeHRM** application. **My tip:**\
      \ Before we look at the API endpoints, let's get familiar with the program first.\
      \ You can find the application in the university network (or via VPN) here:\
      \ https://sepp-hrm.inf.h-brs.de"
  utter_e2s2_story_8:
  - text: Log in there. You can find the login details in the OrangeHRM documentation
      that was provided to you within this course.
  utter_e2s2_story_9:
  - text: Are you logged in now?
  utter_e2s2_story_10:
  - text: Please try it again. Maybe you made a typo.
  utter_e2s2_story_11:
  - text: Now that you are logged in, I would like to say something about OrangeHRM.
      This application is HR tool, which is used to manage a company's employees and
      their important data.
  utter_e2s2_story_12:
  - text: Take a look around and click through the different views.
  utter_e2s2_story_13:
  - text: '**My tip:** Look in particular the list of all available employees.'
  utter_e2s2_story_14:
  - text: Did you find the list?
  utter_e2s2_story_15:
  - text: Click on "PIM" and then select the "Employee List".
  utter_e2s2_story_16:
  - text: Once you've found it, we can go ahead.
  utter_e2s2_story_17:
  - text: Great! ⭐ Now let's try sending our first request to the API.
  utter_e2s2_story_18:
  - text: Have you already found the official documentation of the OrangeHRM REST
      API?
  utter_e2s2_story_19:
  - text: 'No problem, here it is: https://orangehrm.github.io/orangehrm-api-doc/'
  utter_e2s2_story_20:
  - text: You will find the API endpoints in the documentation. That means we can
      send requests to these endpoints. For example, you can get information via GET-HTTP
      requests. With POST-HTTP requests you can write new data to the OrangeHRM application.
  utter_e2s2_story_21:
  - text: Ready for our first request?
  utter_e2s2_story_22:
  - text: Don't worry, we'll do it together! ❤️
  utter_e2s2_story_23:
  - text: We will now request a list of all employees.
  utter_e2s2_story_24:
  - text: Please keep in mind that OrangeHRM uses a Bearer authentication. For that
      you should reuse one of the key-value pairs ('ID', 'secret') that must be inserted
      in the HTTP header.
  utter_e2s2_story_25:
  - text: 'This pair can be found here: / Admin / Configuration / Register OAuth Client'
  utter_e2s2_story_26:
  - text: Prior to our request, a token must be requested. Your task is to send a
      GET-HTTP request to the API and add client_id (see above), client_secret (see
      above) and grant_type = client_credentials to the header.
  utter_e2s2_story_27:
  - text: Let's move on. ⭐ Please open the tool Postman.
  utter_e2s2_story_28:
  - text: '**Step 1:** Create a new request.'
  utter_e2s2_story_29:
  - text: '**Step 2:** Choose GET as the request type'
  utter_e2s2_story_30:
  - text: '**Step 3:** Enter the request URL https://sepp-hrm.inf.h-brs.de/symfony/web/index.php/oauth/issueToken'
  utter_e2s2_story_31:
  - text: '**Step 4:** Paste the key-value pairs in the header as mentioned before.'
  utter_e2s2_story_32:
  - text: '**Step 5:** Send the request!'
  utter_e2s2_story_33:
  - text: '**My tip:** You can save requests in Postman.'
  utter_e2s2_story_34:
  - text: Did it work out? Have you received a reply?
  utter_e2s2_story_35:
  - text: Are you on the university network or in the VPN?
  utter_e2s2_story_36:
  - text: Please try again. Do you have a question about a term?
  utter_e2s2_story_37:
  - text: Does your request work with this help?
  utter_e2s2_story_38:
  - text: Okay, you can either ask me more questions or contact the professor.
  utter_e2s2_story_40:
  - text: Great! Let's continue. ⭐
  utter_e2s2_story_41:
  - text: We have now received the token. Please copy it so that we can paste it into
      our actual request to get a list of all employees.
  utter_e2s2_story_42:
  - text: Create a new GET request. Put the copied token in this request and select
      'Bearer Token' as the type for authorization.
  utter_e2s2_story_43:
  - text: Find the corresponding end point from the official OrangeHRM documentation
      and copy the URL. When you submit this request, you should receive a list of
      employees.
  utter_e2s2_story_44:
  - text: Did you get the list?
  utter_e2s2_story_45:
  - text: Did you find a suitable end point in the documentation? https://orangehrm.github.io/orangehrm-api-doc/
  utter_e2s2_story_46:
  - text: '**My tip:** The end point is / api / v1 / employee / search'
  utter_e2s2_story_47:

  utter_e2s2_story_48:
  - text: Perfect! **Congratulations** on your successful query! 🌟
