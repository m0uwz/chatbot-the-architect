			"title": "Integration architecture",
			"description": "There are multiple definitions for Integration architecture but here's one by Professor Alda: An integration architecture defines **global design decisions** for the integration of potentially *distributed* and *heterogeneous* software components. An integration architecture also makes **implications for tools and frameworks** for developing, testing, andmaintaining *interoperable* software.",

		}, {
			"title": "Architectural styles",
			"description": "Software architecture styles define rules and assumptions for a type (template, class) of software architectures. That means, that the concrete  implementation of a software architecture of a software is an instance of a software architecture style. Here I have an example of the Layer pattern for you:",

			"title": "Legacy system",
			"description": "A legacy system is an old computer system or application program, which is still in use. Often referencing a system as legacy means that it paved the way for the standards that would follow it. This can also imply that the system is out of date or in need of replacement.",

		}, {
			"title": "API",
			"description": "An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries.

			"description": "The Layer Pattern is the decomposition of system functionality in single layers: Presentation Layer, Application Layer, Domain Layer and Infrastructure Layer.
